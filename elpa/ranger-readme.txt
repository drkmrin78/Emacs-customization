This is a derived major mode that runs within dired emulating many of the features of
ranger <https://github.com/hut/ranger>. This minor mode shows a stack of the
parent directories and updates the parent buffers while nvaigating the file
system. The preview window takes some of the ideas from Peep-Dired
<https://github.com/asok/peep-dired> to display previews for selected files
in the primary dired buffer. This package tries its best to make a seamless
user experience from ranger created for python.
